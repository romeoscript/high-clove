                We respect how hard you worked to build your nest egg, and before we recommend anything, we get to know you. We ask questions about your goals and needs, your expenses, your health, your family commitments and more to better understand what you need your money to accomplish. This enables us to recommend a personalized portfolio designed to meet your needs and to help you enjoy the retirement you’ve earned.

                You will receive a personal point of contact, your Investment Counselor, committed to understanding you on a personal level and keeping your financial plan on track. Your Investment Counselor will be there for you, whether you want to know how your portfolio is doing and why, or whether you want guidance when the ups and downs of the stock market rattle your nerves. Your Investment Counselor will keep in touch in all market conditions and won’t be afraid to give you an occasional dose of tough love to help you stay disciplined to your long-term plan.

                We’re more than just stock pickers. We believe active portfolio management centered on your long-term goals is the best way to discover opportunities and achieve long-term results. Our five-person Investment Policy Committee, supported by a large in-house research staff, analyzes global investing opportunities narrowing down from country and sector to find securities they think will do well moving forward. This disciplined approach allows us to interpret information differently and find global investing opportunities other money managers may overlook.

We proactively discuss current events and openly share our forecast with you through your Investment Counselor, live events, quarterly reviews, regular publications like MarketMinder and more. Whether you’re someone who wants to dig in to the details of your portfolio or you want to be more hands-off, we provide a variety of resources to get you the information you need, when you need it all to make sure you’re comfortable with our investing approach
